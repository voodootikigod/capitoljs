            <p>CapitolJS is bringing together 12 of the top minds in the JS community to provide you with the most exciting presentations and discussions. Presentations will be geared toward every day application and use so you will leave CapitolJS ready to write amazing JS. They have been out in the field and seen the action and now they have come back to prepare you, agent, for the world of JS.</p>
            <h4>We Want To Hear From You</h4>
            <p>If you want to present at CapitolJS on a topic, product, or idea that you have, much like JSConf there will be a Track B for lightning talks and hackfests. Speaking in Track B is completely free form, but you must be a registered attendee. Sign up will be done at the conference, so start preparing your topic to present today and get ready.</p>

                Evented programming has become critical throughout        the entire stack as the web evolves to include real-time         capabilities. Javascript was born to be `evented`, making it         a great choice to promote a non-blocking style of programming         on the server. Let's look at how you can apply your browser        programming knowledge to build realistic, scalable, and robust network programs using Javascript!

                Back in the old days, the early web APIs were XML based and could only be accessed from server-side scripting (like SOAP APIs - ick!). Nowadays, thanks to modern web technologies and clever hacks, more and more APIs are Javascript-friendly (look ma, no servers!). This talk will show you how we got to where we are today, expose you to the wide number of APIs that you can use from JS in your  web apps, and equip you with tools & tips for using those APIs.

                What actually happens when you set a property on an element's style? Or when you add a stylesheet? This talk walks you through a bit of how modern web engines think about these sorts of things and how they interact with your JavaScript so you can structure your applications in ways that work with the system, not against it.

                For much of its existence, JavaScript has been slow. No one complained until developers created complex web applications with thousands of lines of JavaScript code. Although newer JavaScript engines have improved the situation, thereâ€™s still a lot to understand about what makes JavaScript slow and what you can do to speed up your code.

                of JavaScript, in which players collaborate to squeeze as much punch
                into 140 bytes as possible. It follows in the footsteps of popular
                JavaScript code-golf championships 10K APART and JS1K, ratcheting down
                the size constraints another order of magnitude to capture both the
                pith and the inanity of Twitter in machine-readable form. In this
