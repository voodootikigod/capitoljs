    %p CapitolJS is bringing together 12 of the top minds in the JS community to provide you with the most exciting presentations and discussions. Presentations will be geared toward every day application and use so you will leave CapitolJS ready to write amazing JS. They have been out in the field and seen the action and now they have come back to prepare you, agent, for the world of JS. 

    %h4 We Want To Hear From You
    %p If you want to present at CapitolJS on a topic, product, or idea that you have, much like JSConf there will be a Track B for lightning talks and hackfests. Speaking in Track B is completely free form, but you must be a registered attendee. Sign up will be done at the conference, so start preparing your topic to present today and get ready.
