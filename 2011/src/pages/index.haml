    %p As with a JSConf event, there will be a free-form Track B sponsored by the amazing people at R/GA. When you get to CapitolJS, there will be a sign up sheet at registration for you to pick a slot if you want to speak. Each slot is for 15 minutes, so it is a bit rapid fire, but allows everyone to speak who might want to speak. Be sure to check the Track B schedule through out the day as it will be just as amazing as Track A, it always is. 
    %p Also for those of you wishing to "break-away" and cut some code with the speakers, we have a fully catered Hacker's Lounge ready for you care of the Phono team. The hacker's lounge is all the goodness of a hallconf, but in a semi-organized (and a lot more comfortable) fashion. Be sure to indulge in some coding goodness at CapitolJS, its half the fun of the event to be able to say "I hacked with Joe McCann".
    %p We are very much looking forward to seeing you at CapitolJS!
